##Description
This is a simple web interface for a Food Recognition system. It allows users to upload an image of food using the "Choose File" button, and then click "Predict" to get the systemâ€™s classification of the food item. The interface is designed for easy interaction, likely backed by a machine learning model that processes and identifies the uploaded food image.

#Description
The image shows the result of an image classification task. The system has identified the object in the image as "pizza" with a high confidence level of 99.92%. The pizza appears to be topped with slices of avocado, some green herbs, and possibly bits of ham or bacon. The classification result is visually confirmed by the presence of a round, baked flatbread base with visible toppings, consistent with the appearance of a pizza.
